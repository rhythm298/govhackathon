This is a React application that visualizes and helps manage traffic congestion in urban areas. The dashboard provides real-time traffic data, historical patterns, and predictive analytics to support traffic management decisions.

## Features

- Interactive map showing traffic congestion levels in different areas
- Real-time incident tracking and management
- Historical traffic pattern visualization
- Traffic prediction for the next 8 hours
- Traffic management action buttons

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

## Installation and Setup

## Dependencies

- React
- Material-UI
- React-Leaflet (for maps)
- Recharts (for charts and graphs)
- Axios (for API requests)

## Data Sources

The current implementation uses simulated data. In a production environment, you would connect to:
- Traffic monitoring APIs
- City traffic department data feeds
- Weather service APIs
- Incident reporting systems

## Customization

You can customize the dashboard by:
1. Changing the map center coordinates in the TrafficDashboard component
2. Adding more traffic management actions
3. Connecting to real data sources by replacing the sample data generation functions
4. Modifying the UI theme in App.js
