## Project Overview

### Traffic Congestion Prediction

Urban areas worldwide face significant traffic congestion, leading to increased travel times, fuel consumption, and air pollution. Traditional traffic management systems often rely on static rules and manual interventions, which may not adapt effectively to real-time traffic conditions. This project aims to develop an AI-based system capable of analyzing live traffic feeds, weather conditions, and historical data to predict congestion points and optimize traffic flow.

### Disease Surveillance

Timely detection of disease outbreaks is crucial for public health. Traditional surveillance methods can be slow due to manual reporting and fragmented data sources. This project proposes an AI-driven predictive analytics system to monitor health trends and detect early warning signs of disease outbreaks by integrating data from various sources, including health records, social media, and environmental factors.

## Features

- **Real-Time Traffic Analysis:** Utilizes live traffic camera feeds, GPS data, and weather information to predict congestion and optimize traffic signals.
- **Disease Outbreak Prediction:** Analyzes electronic health records, social media trends, and environmental data to forecast potential disease hotspots.
- **Dashboard Visualization:** Interactive dashboards for visualizing traffic conditions and health alerts.
- **Automated Alerts:** Sends notifications to relevant authorities for quick response to traffic incidents or potential disease outbreaks.

## Architecture

The system comprises two main components:

1. **Traffic Management Module:**
   - **Data Ingestion:** Collects data from traffic cameras, GPS devices, and weather APIs.
   - **Prediction Engine:** Employs machine learning models to forecast traffic congestion.
   - **Signal Optimization:** Adjusts traffic signals in real-time based on predictions.
   - **Visualization:** Displays traffic conditions on a user-friendly dashboard.

2. **Disease Surveillance Module:**
   - **Data Aggregation:** Gathers data from health records, social media, and environmental sensors.
   - **Analysis Engine:** Uses natural language processing and machine learning to detect anomalies indicating potential outbreaks.
   - **Alert System:** Issues warnings to health authorities and the public through various channels.
   - **Visualization:** Presents outbreak data on an interactive map.

## Installation

To set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rhythm298/govhackathon.git
   cd govhackathon
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
   - Add necessary configurations (e.g., API keys, database URLs).

5. **Initialize the Database:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage

- **Access the Dashboard:**
  - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser to access the interactive dashboard.

- **API Endpoints:**
  - Traffic Data: `GET /api/traffic`
  - Disease Data: `GET /api/disease`

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Use the dashboard to view real-time traffic conditions and disease surveillance maps.

-**For Ai predictive diseases analysis dashboard**
 **File Extension and Requirements**
- To run this dashboard, you'll need to install these Python packages:
 ```bash 
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly dash dash-bootstrap-components scikit-learn scipy
 ```
Install the required packages
Run the script with python disease_surveillance_dashboard.py
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050/

The dashboard uses Dash (built on Flask) to create an interactive web application that you can access through your browser. The code generates sample disease data for demonstration purposes, but in a real implementation, you would connect to your actual data sources.

## Data Sources

- **Traffic Data:**
  - Live traffic camera feeds.
  - GPS data from public transportation and ride-sharing services.
  - Weather information from meteorological APIs.

- **Disease Data:**
  - Electronic health records from participating hospitals and clinics.
  - Social media platforms (e.g., Twitter) for trend analysis.
  - Environmental sensors monitoring factors like air quality.
